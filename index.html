Mr. Darwin took the time to explain every detail, making sure that we felt confident in our decision as first time home buyer.

He is an excellent and supportive person. He was very supportive throughout the entire loan sanction process.  He not only supported during sanction process, he also ensured that the disbursement process was smooth and was credited to the builder's account on time after each milestone.

His dedicated follow-ups and expertise made what could otherwise have been a stressful situation into a smooth and positive experience.

Thanks to Darwin and his team, we secured the perfect loan for our dream home.

            <p align="justify">"I am A G Soundararajan ,retired Chief Manager of a Nationalised Bank and it will take minimum 15 to 20 working days to process a 
housing loan proposal . 
We will be resting the borrower to go to the approved panel lawyer for a legal opinion on the property and then the borrower will be directed to go to the  
panel approved Engineer for valuation of the construction or the estimated value is reasonable. All these will take atleast a week time and then the entire 
set of documents will be sent to the controlling office and they will take their sweet time till such time the borrower will be kept in suspense whether the 
loan will be sanctioned or not .<br>
When my son who is an NRI and in US at that time only he has completed his MS and campus selected and working for an insurance company for less than a year. I 
just approached Mr Darwin for a housing project where house will be delivered by the builder after two years. Darwin immediately took my son's E mail and telephone
 number and third day I received a mail from my son that a Power of Attorney was executed in my name and all the related documents were sent by courier. 
Immediately I received a call from Darwin regarding on receipt of the courier what I should do. The best part is he said keep the courier cover safe. I was wondering 
what is the purpose of safekeeping of the courier cover later when the PoA was registered and when the property was registered the registrar was asking from where you 
received the POA. At that time I was able to produce the courier cover and the registrar was very happy to approve my requests. Why Iam telling this is he is not only 
knows the nuances of the latest procedure and also guides the borrower at the appropriate time. The entire loan was processed in two days and loan was disbursed and 
I was wondering sitting at home and when the link was sent to my son for the repayment he could not believe that such things are possible in India.<br>
The crux here is I have to admit that not only loan was disbursed and even I was away at Delhi I could get the second installment of the loan to the builder by
 remitting the margin from a branch where i was not having any account.
The best part is my son in law also availed a loan through Darwin sitting at Delhi he purchased a property in Chennai and he came Chennai only for registration
 of the property.
I have to admit that the loans availed through Darwin were closed within five years and we are not the borrowers anymore and we are the proud owners of the
 property there is a special touch of luck with Darwin that not only the processing of loan but repayment of the loan is also happened with the same velocity. 
This I can say Midos touch of Darwin only helped me to avail NRI Housing loan and I wish him all success in all  his endeavours.

            <p align="justify">"I was in the look out for a Home loan around 2015 when I had plans to purchase an apartment in Nanganallur. My friend introduced me to Darwin. Darwin has been a great guy helping me sort out all the necessary paperwork for the Loan processing. I've never had any hassle of getting my Loan sanctioned as Darwin has taken care of everything so smoothly. It was so fast that the loan was processed and the initial amount displatched in no time to the builder. All the great work goes to Darwin. Even after the loan was processed, he is always willing to sort all my doubts with a lot of patience. Darwin is a great guy to work with and I can recommend him with my eyes closed to anyone who is looking to pursue any loan or property. Great work Darwin and my best wishes to all your future endeavours. Keep Rocking..
